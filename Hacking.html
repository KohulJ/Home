<h1> Hacking </h1>
<p1> Your character's biggest weapon is hacking. Marcus can hack his way past security gates, key-card operated doors, garages, and so much more. He can use his phone to remotely drive other cars, scramble enemy communications, and can even set off explosives, such as steam pipes below the ground! If you're being chased, you can set up a steam pipe below you to proximity, so the next police car then drives thorugh the field of proximity will set off the pipe and will explode. It's really handy when you're being chased by a ton of police. 
Marcus can hack people's cell phones to shock them, or to just hear what they are saying or see what they're texting. He can call the SWAT or a gang hit on anyone, just by pressing a couple of buttons. This is very useful when you're trying to set up a distraction, and there's even a Mass Systems Crash, which shuts down everything electronic in an area, and causes a blackout!</p1>
