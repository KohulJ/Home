Marcus Holloway is a hacker who decides to join the hacker group DedSec, whose mission is to take power from the corrupt in order to help the people.
        Marcus is the main character. In this game, there is a campaign mode, an open world mode, and an online mode. The game has a huge assortment of vehicles and weapons, with many customization options. Currency is earned by completing missions or finding Money Bags. The graphics are excellent, and in certain parts of the map, there are
        some really nice scenic views. There are paint jobs and outfits hidden around the map that players can go find, and also several cool Easter eggs, some of which include an Assassin's Creed poster downtown, the Ubisoft office, and several references to other games.

        <h1> About the Developers </h1>
        <p1>
            Ubisoft is a very successful company that has many successful franchises, some of which include "Just Dance","Assassin's Creed", and "Far Cry." Watch Dogs was a huge success, so it's no surprise that a second was on its way.
            The company was founded in France by 5 brothers in 1986. Since then, they have made games and collaborated with other huge franchises such as "Electronic Arts." In fact, EA tried to buy them out once. And once again, just last year,
            French mass media company Vivendi bought some of their stock in two parts, coming away with 10.4% of Ubisoft's shares. At this point, the company is worth over 6 billion dollars.
